# Hexagon Lamp
Lamp base and shade 

Â© 2020, Taylor Lucas Barrett

This industrial design project was created for a digital fabrication class assignment. The purpose of the project was to make a 3-D shape in Rhino, slice the shape into layers, laser cut the layers from 2-D material, and then re-stack the layers to create a physical copy of the original 3-D digital design. 

Materials used:

- Laser cut 1/8" plywood (about 40 hexagon shapes created in Rhino)
- Spray paint
- Wire mesh
- Wood glue
- Wire thread
- Lightbulb socket and cord (purchased)
- Vintage lightbulb (purchased)
- Wire lampshade skeleton (purchased)
